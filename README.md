# Snake-game using python.

In this project, we have created a snake game using a python module named  “Pygame”. Basically, in this game, the user will control the movement of the snake through the keyboard arrows and direct the snake in the direction of food, as the snake eats the food the size of the snake will get increase. While playing the game if the snake hits the boundaries or the snake head hits its own body then the game will get over and accordingly the score will get displayed. 

# Installation:
To work with this project you need to install pygame module via pip installation.

To install the module open your terminal and run the command below:

$ python -m pip install pygame
